        Our customers are our partners. You provide us with information on your
        crop yield rates and factors that influenced those rates. We provide
        resources to help you sucessfully calculate how to use certain
        agricultural products. This partnership allows us to improve the overall
        experience of the farming experience in communities that may not have
        the necessary knowledge or resources to maximize crop yields.
